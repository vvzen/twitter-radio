Second term project for my Physical Computing class at Goldsmiths!

A full description with additional images and sketches can be found here: [http://doc.gold.ac.uk/compartsblog/index.php/work/twitterhead/](http://doc.gold.ac.uk/compartsblog/index.php/work/twitterhead/)

### Additional Software
Code for the LCD display running on the raspberry pi zero is available here: [https://github.com/vvzen/rpi-lcd-client.git](https://github.com/vvzen/rpi-lcd-client.git)

### Hardware
The project utilises two main boards: a [udoox86](https://www.udoo.org) and a [raspberry pi zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/).
Additional components are:
1. A USB-TO-TTL converter (similar to [this one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Raspberry-Programming-Serial-Windows-Supported/dp/B01N4X3BJB/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1523202077&sr=8-1&keywords=usb+to+ttl))
2. USB Keyboard
3. 16x2 LCD display (I used the one that comes with the arduino starter kit)
4. Stereo amplifier circuit ([bought from Maplin](https://www.maplin.co.uk/p/mindsets-stereo-amplifier-solder-kit-n01qq), but any other one will be good too)
5. A pair of [8 ohm speakers](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cylewet-Speaker-Loudspeaker-Arduino-CLW1038/dp/B073XJJ99N/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1523202024&sr=8-1&keywords=8+ohm+speakers)


The 3d printed parts can be found here: [https://github.com/vvzen/MACA/tree/master/end-1-term-projects/phc-2/3d_printing](https://github.com/vvzen/MACA/tree/master/end-1-term-projects/phc-2/3d_printing)
